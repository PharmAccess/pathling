# Server base

There are a number of operations within the Pathling FHIR API that pass back
URLs referring back to API endpoints. The host and protocol components of these
URLs are automatically detected based upon the details of the incoming request.

In some cases it might be desirable to override the hostname and protocol,
particularly where Pathling is being hosted behind some sort of proxy. To
account for this, Pathling also supports the use of the
[X-Forwarded-Proto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Proto),
[X-Forwarded-Host](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Host)
and `X-Forwarded-Port` headers to override the protocol, hostname and port
within URLs sent back by the API.
