# Java

The Pathling FHIR encoders can be accessed from within Java applications, using
the `au.csiro.pathling:encoders` package available
from [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). See the [Encoders](/docs/encoders) page
for more details.

We have also published API documentation for the functionality within the server
implementation, including the FHIRPath parser, operations and terminology
functions. Note that this has not yet been published to Maven.
