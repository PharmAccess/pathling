# Python

A Python package named [pathling](https://pypi.org/project/pathling/) is
available from PyPI, which enables use of the Spark encoders. See the
[Encoders](/docs/encoders) page for more details.

We are currently working on adding more functionality to this library, such as
access to the operations (`aggregate`, `search`, `extract`) and also standalone
implementations of the terminology functions (`memberOf`, `subsumes`,
`translate`).
