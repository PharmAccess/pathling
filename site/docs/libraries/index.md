# Libraries

Pathling provides a set of libraries that provide assistance with
using [FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir)
and [terminology services](https://hl7.org/fhir/terminology-service.html) from
Apache Spark applications and data science workflows. The libraries are
available for Python, Scala and Java.

We also have upcoming support for R, subscribe to
