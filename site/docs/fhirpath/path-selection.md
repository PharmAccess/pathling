# Path selection

Source:
[http://hl7.org/fhirpath/2018Sep/index.html#path-selection](http://hl7.org/fhirpath/2018Sep/index.html#path-selection)

FHIRPath allows navigation through the tree by composing a path of concatenated
labels, e.g.

```
name.given
```

This would result in a collection of nodes, one with the value "Wouter" and one
with the value "Gert". In fact, each step in such a path results in a collection
of nodes by selecting nodes with the given label from the step before it. The
input collection at the beginning of the evaluation contained all elements from
Patient, and the path name selected just those named name. Since the name
element repeats, the next step given along the path, will contain all nodes
labeled given from all nodes name in the preceding step.

The path may start with the type of the root node (which otherwise does not have
a name), but this is optional. To illustrate this point, the path name.given
above can be evaluated as an expression on a set of data of any type. However
the expression may be prefixed with the name of the type of the root:

```
Patient.name.given
```

The two expressions have the same outcome, but when evaluating the second, the
evaluation will only produce results when used on data of type Patient.

Syntactically, FHIRPath defines identifiers as any sequence of characters
consisting only of letters, digits, and underscores, beginning with a letter or
underscore.

<div class="callout warning">The use of backticks to include other characters within paths is not currently supported.</div>

When resolving an identifier that is also the root of a FHIRPath expression, it
is resolved as a type name first, and if it resolves to a type, it must resolve
to the type of the context (or a supertype). Otherwise, it is resolved as a path
on the context.

## Collections

Source:
[https://hl7.org/fhirpath/2018Sep/index.html#collections](https://hl7.org/fhirpath/2018Sep/index.html#collections)

Collections are fundamental to FHIRPath, in that the result of every expression
is a collection, even if that expression only results in a single element. This
approach allows paths to be specified without having to care about the
cardinality of any particular element, and is therefore ideally suited to graph
traversal.

Within FHIRPath, a collection is:

- Ordered - The order of items in the collection is important and is preserved
  through operations as much as possible.
- Non-Unique - Duplicate elements are allowed within a collection. Some
  functions, such as distinct() and the union operator | produce collections of
  unique elements, but in general, duplicate elements are allowed.
- Indexed - Each item in a collection can be uniquely addressed by itâ€™s index,
  i.e. ordinal position within the collection.
- Unless specified otherwise by the underlying Object Model, the first item in a
  collection has index 0. Note that if the underlying model specifies that a
  collection is 1-based (the only reasonable alternative to 0-based
  collections), any collections generated from operations on the 1-based list
  are 0-based.
- Countable - The number of items in a given collection can always be determined
  using the count() function

Note that the outcome of operations like children() and descendants() cannot be
assumed to be in any meaningful order, and first(), last(), tail(), skip() and
take() should not be used on collections derived from these paths. Note that
some implementations may follow the logical order implied by the data model, and
some may not, and some may be different depending on the underlying source.

## Paths and polymorphic items

Source:
[https://hl7.org/fhirpath/2018Sep/index.html#paths-and-polymorphic-items](https://hl7.org/fhirpath/2018Sep/index.html#paths-and-polymorphic-items)

In the underlying representation of data, nodes may be typed and represent
polymorphic items. Paths may either ignore the type of a node, and continue
along the path or may be explicit about the expected node and filter the set of
nodes by type before navigating down child nodes:

```
Observation.value.unit - all kinds of value
Observation.value.ofType(Quantity).unit - only values that are of type Quantity
```
